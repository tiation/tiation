# Competition vs. Cooperation: The Scientific Evidence

*By Perry W. Buffington, Ph.D. (Reformatted and preserved from original publication)*

## Executive Summary

Scientific research consistently demonstrates that cooperation produces better outcomes than competition across multiple domains:

- **Higher productivity**: Cooperative scientists publish more articles
- **Better compensation**: Cooperative businesspeople earn higher salaries  
- **Academic achievement**: Cooperative students maintain higher GPAs
- **Creativity enhancement**: Cooperation significantly increases creative output
- **Psychological benefits**: Cooperation improves self-esteem and sense of community
- **Health advantages**: Cooperative individuals show better psychological adjustment and physical health

Despite these findings, competition remains overemphasized in business, education, healthcare, and parenting—potentially costing billions in lost productivity and human achievement.

## The Research Evidence

> "If in fact competition brings out the 'beast' in us, then research demonstrates that cooperation surely brings out the 'best' in us."

This finding has been consistently demonstrated across virtually every occupation, skill, and behavior tested over decades of research. The scientific consensus is clear and compelling:

### Academic Research Basis

Dr. David W. Johnson and Dr. Roger T. Johnson, professors at the University of Minnesota and co-directors of the Cooperative Learning Center, have built "a research base of over 500 studies dating back to the turn of the century." Their work conclusively demonstrates the superiority of cooperative approaches.

### Education Findings

Cooperative learning environments produce:
- Higher grade point averages from elementary through college education
- Improved self-esteem among learners
- Enhanced sense of community and belonging
- Greater acceptance among peers

As Roger Johnson explains: "If we are to teach people to be cooperative, then education and psychology must work together. You see, a typical classroom teacher is taught to keep students quiet and apart, indirectly fostering competition. Yet... people learn best when they work cooperatively with each other."

### Professional Achievement

The research shows cooperation leads to:
- Higher publication rates among scientists
- Increased salaries among business professionals
- Lower job vacancy rates when personnel directors work cooperatively
- Enhanced creativity across professional domains

### Health Implications

A fascinating study conducted by the Cooperative Learning Center examined 57 collegiate and semi-professional ice hockey players (aged 18-29) trying out for the 1980 Olympic team. Using sophisticated personality measures and social-interaction scales, researchers found:

- More cooperative individuals were better adjusted psychologically
- Cooperative players were physically healthier than competitive colleagues
- Competition created unhealthy physical side effects
- Cooperation generated positive physiological responses similar to "runner's high"

Published in the *Journal of Psychology* (May 1986), the study demonstrates that "cooperation does much more than help people get along."

### Psychological Benefits

Individuals who develop a cooperative stance tend to:
- Feel more in control of their lives
- Be less dependent on external approval
- Experience reduced stress levels
- Report higher overall wellbeing

This contrasts sharply with "the constant intensity of the competitive individual."

## The Balance Point: Avoiding Groupthink

While cooperation shows clear advantages, researchers acknowledge that excessive cooperation without critical thinking can lead to "groupthink" or "yes-man syndrome." 

Scott G. Isaksen, director for Studies in Creativity at Buffalo State College, explains: "If everyone is so caught up in cooperation with the other side that they lose a critical respect for the issue, they can all decide to do the wrong thing unanimously."

The ideal approach combines cooperative processes with maintained objectivity: "Although there's no doubt that a cooperative environment increases the number of ideas, improves the quality of the outcome, and facilitates a better working environment, cooperation must be done in such a way as to protect the integrity of the project at hand."

## 10 Practical Techniques to Facilitate Cooperation

The following evidence-based techniques can be applied in any environment, from corporate settings to youth sports:

### 1. Focus on doing well, not beating others
Isaksen points out that attempting to do well and trying to beat others are separate mental processes. It's impossible to concentrate on both simultaneously. Cooperating to create positive outcomes delivers more rewards.

### 2. Allow ample time
Cooperation deteriorates under time pressure, leading to non-agreement, decreased information exchange, and firmer demands. The perception of available time facilitates cooperation.

### 3. Use similar language
When seeking cooperation, use the same words others have used to describe plans. This creates what psychologists call "congruence," allowing you to appear cooperative while still gathering critical information.

### 4. Share leadership
Cooperation functions as a form of shared leadership. When leadership is distributed, members take more initiative and develop stronger ownership of ideas, creating a more pleasant work environment.

### 5. Learn cooperative problem-solving tools
These include creativity techniques like brainstorming, which invites others to offer suggestions that can be built upon collaboratively. Other approaches include suspending judgment, clarifying objectives before seeking cooperation, and non-threatening evaluation.

### 6. Practice reciprocity
When someone helps you, make it a point to help them in return—ideally before they expect it. Research in international relations shows this "general reciprocity" is one of the few reliable ways to gain an adversary's cooperation.

### 7. Share resources and information
Competition for knowledge, workspace, personnel, or other resources decreases cooperation. Resource exchange encourages collaboration.

### 8. Reinforce team efforts
Rather than recognizing individual achievement, use a team approach where the entire group is rewarded for success. Distribute rewards equally to minimize individual competition and maximize cooperation.

### 9. Act cooperatively
Research shows that witnessing cooperative acts creates a "pay it forward" effect. Helping others "increases the probability that they will be cooperative toward you."

### 10. Experience cooperation for health benefits
Notice the positive physiological and psychological effects of cooperation. As research suggests, once you experience these benefits, "there seems to be no other way to work except cooperatively."

## Conclusion

Cooperation is a valuable approach that works best when freely given and indirectly encouraged. The scientific evidence consistently demonstrates its superiority across multiple domains of human achievement, wellbeing, and health.

Despite this compelling evidence, most educational, business, and social systems continue to emphasize competition. By realigning our approach with the scientific consensus, we can unlock significant improvements in productivity, creativity, psychological wellbeing, and social cohesion.
