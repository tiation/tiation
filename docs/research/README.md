# Grief-to-Design Research

This directory contains comprehensive research, case studies, and theoretical frameworks supporting the Grief-to-Design methodology and related systemic transformation approaches.

## Core Research Documents

### Foundational Theories

#### [Two Monkey Theory](./two-monkey-theory.md)
Analysis of evolutionary and psychological foundations of power imbalance, cooperation, and collective action. Examines why numerically superior groups often accept domination by smaller elites and provides evidence-based approaches to overcome barriers to collective action.

**Key Insights:**
- Capuchin fairness experiments and implications for human systems
- Mechanisms that maintain inequality despite numerical disadvantages
- Historical examples of collective awakening and transformation
- Connection to modern economic applications

#### [Cooperative Capitalism](./cooperative-capitalism.md)
Comprehensive framework for an economic system that preserves market mechanisms while restructuring ownership, governance, and incentive systems to prioritize cooperation, sustainability, and shared prosperity.

**Key Components:**
- Five foundational principles (distributed ownership, stakeholder governance, market design, public-commons-private balance, long-term value creation)
- Real-world examples (Mondragón, ESOPs, Benefit Corporations, Platform Cooperatives)
- Implementation pathways and economic advantages
- Connection to other grief-to-design concepts

#### [Prevention Over Punishment Framework](./prevention-over-punishment-framework.md)
Theoretical and practical framework explaining why "starting good" is more effective than "stopping bad" for social interventions.

**Core Principle:** Grow what we want until what we don't want has nowhere to live.

**Design Pillars:**
- Belonging loops and community connection
- Skills that travel through joyful learning
- Shared infrastructure for resource circulation
- Celebrated data and positive storytelling
- Narrative seeds that create folk heroes

## Case Studies and Applications

### [Case Study: Maternal Filicide False Accusations and System Failures](./case-study-maternal-filicide-false-accusations.md)
Detailed analysis of how a family's false accusation of maternal revenge filicide gained traction with government workers despite having virtually zero statistical probability.

**Key Findings:**
- Maternal revenge filicide probability: <0.001% of child deaths
- Accidental drowning probability: 15% of all childhood deaths
- Risk ratio: Accidental drowning is ~15,000x more likely
- Systematic cognitive bias failures in professional decision-making
- Connection to grief-to-design principles for system reform

**Impact Areas:**
- Child protection system reform
- Statistical literacy in professional training
- Family scapegoating dynamics
- Trauma-informed approaches to false accusations

## Communication and Implementation

### [Communicating with Average Joe](./communicating-with-average-joe.md)
Practical guide for communicating complex statistical and social issues to non-expert audiences when logic alone fails to convince.

**Key Strategies:**
- Re-package ideas to feel true before proving true
- Borrow audience values through moral reframing
- Use sticky one-liners that bypass statistics
- Turn spectators into doers through micro-actions
- Deploy question-first, answer-second tactics

**Communication Principles:**
- Story before statistics
- Questions before conclusions
- Action before argument
- Values before data

## Additional Research Documents

### Behavioral and Social Analysis

#### [Cooperation vs Competition: Same Benefits, Different Costs](./cooperation-competition-benefits-costs.md)
Scientific evidence that cooperation achieves same performance as competition without stress costs.

#### [Trust-First Governance Mechanics](./trust-first-mechanics.md)
How abundance enables trust-based systems rather than control-based systems.

Complete trust-first framework for institutional design.

### Systemic Analysis

#### [Reality Check: $19T Solution](./reality-check-19t-solution.md)
Mathematical and political feasibility analysis of the 19 Trillion Dollar Solution.

#### [Selective Attention and Systemic Blindness](./selective-attention-systemic-blindness.md)
How cognitive biases prevent recognition of systemic solutions.

#### [Trust, Scarcity, and Security](./trust-scarcity-security.md)
Analysis of how scarcity thinking undermines both trust and actual security.

### Specialized Topics

#### [Family Trauma, Scapegoating, and Innocence](./family-trauma-scapegoating-and-innocence.md)
Deep dive into family system dynamics and protective mechanisms.

#### [Legal Precedents: Child Drowning Cases (Expanded)](./legal-precedents-child-drowning-expanded.md)
Comprehensive legal analysis of childhood drowning cases and precedents.

#### [Unconscious Bias and Constructed Norms](./unconscious-bias-constructed-norms.md)
How social norms are constructed and maintained through unconscious bias.

#### [Decolonization Frameworks](./decolonization-frameworks.md)
Approaches to decolonizing institutional thinking and practice.
