# Financial Analysis & Models for the $19 Trillion Solution

This directory contains the complete financial analysis, calculations, and projections that demonstrate the viability and implementation pathway for the $19 Trillion Solution.

## Directory Structure

- `data/` - Raw economic data sources and reference figures
- `models/` - Calculation models and financial simulations
- `visualizations/` - Charts, graphs, and visual representations of the economics
- `reports/` - Comprehensive financial reports and analysis documents

## Core Financial Premise

The $19 Trillion Solution is based on the fact that Australia's total national wealth is approximately $19 trillion, while current governmental debts and annual costs represent only a fraction of this wealth. By unlocking this wealth and distributing it according to the framework outlined in these documents, we can simultaneously:

1. Erase all national and state/territory debt (~$786.815 billion)
2. Pre-fund all government services for five years (~$5.29 trillion)
3. Distribute the remaining ~$12.92 trillion directly to citizens

## Key Financial Questions Addressed

The documents in this directory provide detailed answers to the following questions:

1. **Source of Wealth**: What comprises Australia's $19 trillion in national wealth?
2. **Liquidation Mechanisms**: How can this wealth be accessed without disrupting markets?
3. **Distribution Mathematics**: How are the per-capita figures calculated?
4. **Inflation Control**: How will this distribution avoid triggering inflation?
5. **Economic Stability**: What mechanisms ensure continued economic functioning?
6. **Long-term Sustainability**: How will the system remain viable beyond the initial five years?
