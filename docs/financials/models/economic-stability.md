# Economic Stability Framework

This document outlines the mechanisms designed to maintain economic stability during and after implementation of the $19 Trillion Solution, addressing concerns about inflation, market disruption, and long-term economic functioning.

## Core Economic Challenges

The redistribution of $19 trillion in wealth presents several economic challenges that must be addressed:

| Challenge | Description | Risk Level |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Inflation | Rapid increase in money supply could trigger inflation | High |
| Asset Market Disruption | Potential for asset price volatility during wealth transfer | Medium-High |
| Productivity Incentives | Maintaining work motivation and economic productivity | Medium |
| Currency Stability | International confidence in AUD and exchange rate impacts | Medium |
| Supply Chain Capacity | Ability of production systems to meet new demand patterns | Medium |
| Wealth Flight | Risk of capital leaving Australia during implementation | Low-Medium |

## Inflation Management Framework

Multiple coordinated mechanisms will control inflation risk:

### 1. Metered Distribution System
