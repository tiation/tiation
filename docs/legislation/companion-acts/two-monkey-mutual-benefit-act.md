# Two-Monkey Mutual-Benefit Act

## Short Title
Two-Monkey Mutual-Benefit Act 2025

## Purpose
To establish a fundamental principle that any policy or decision affecting multiple parties must provide net benefit to all affected parties, preventing the exploitation of some for the benefit of others.

## Findings
The Parliament finds that:
1. Many current policies create winners and losers unnecessarily
2. True prosperity requires mutual benefit rather than zero-sum competition
3. Sustainable societies are built on cooperation, not exploitation
4. Policy decisions should enhance rather than diminish human wellbeing

## Definitions
**Mutual Benefit**: An outcome where all affected parties experience net positive improvement in their wellbeing, security, or opportunities.

**Affected Party**: Any individual, group, or community that experiences material impact from a policy or decision.

**Net Harm**: Any policy outcome that requires some parties to suffer loss, disadvantage, or reduced wellbeing for others to benefit.

## Core Principle: The Two-Monkey Test

### Section 1: Policy Assessment Standard
All proposed legislation, regulations, and government decisions must pass the Two-Monkey Test:
- **Test Question**: "Would I implement this policy if both affected parties were my beloved pets?"
- **Standard**: If the answer is no, the policy cannot proceed without redesign

### Section 2: Mutual Benefit Requirement
No policy may proceed that:
1. Requires net harm to any party for others to benefit
2. Redistributes suffering rather than creating wellbeing
3. Forces trade-offs between basic human needs
4. Creates artificial scarcity to manage distribution

### Section 3: Alternative Solution Mandate
When initial proposals fail the Two-Monkey Test, decision-makers must:
1. Identify the underlying need or problem
2. Design solutions that benefit all affected parties
3. Increase total available resources rather than redistributing scarcity
4. Seek win-win outcomes through abundance-based thinking

## Implementation

### Section 4: Assessment Process
All policy proposals must include:
1. **Affected Party Analysis**: Identification of all materially impacted groups
2. **Benefit Distribution Map**: Clear documentation of how each party benefits
3. **Harm Mitigation Plan**: Elimination or compensation for any negative impacts
4. **Alternative Solutions Review**: Evidence that win-win approaches were explored

### Section 5: Oversight Mechanism
A Mutual Benefit Commission shall:
1. Review all major policy proposals for compliance
2. Provide alternative solution development support
3. Monitor implementation outcomes for affected parties
4. Report annually on adherence to mutual benefit principles

### Section 6: Exemptions and Emergency Provisions
Limited exemptions may apply only when:
1. Immediate physical safety requires urgent action
2. Temporary measures are needed while permanent solutions develop
3. All affected parties consent to temporary disadvantage
4. Clear timeline exists for achieving mutual benefit

## Enforcement

### Section 7: Policy Review Authority
The Commission may:
1. Require policy redesign before implementation
2. Mandate benefit enhancement measures
3. Recommend legislative amendments for compliance
4. Issue public reports on policy impacts

### Section 8: Citizen Enforcement
Any affected party may petition for review of:
1. Existing policies that create net harm
2. New proposals lacking mutual benefit
3. Implementation failures to deliver promised benefits
4. Systematic violations of the mutual benefit principle

## Transition Provisions

### Section 9: Existing Policy Review
Within 24 months of enactment:
1. All major existing policies shall be reviewed for compliance
2. Harmful policies shall be redesigned or eliminated
3. Affected parties shall receive remediation for past harms
4. New abundance-based alternatives shall be implemented

### Section 10: Cultural Transformation
Government agencies shall:
1. Train staff in abundance-based problem solving
2. Develop win-win solution methodologies
3. Measure success by universal benefit rather than selective advantage
4. Foster cooperation rather than competition between constituencies

## Connection to Other Reforms

This Act works in conjunction with:
- **Sovereign Equity Fund Act**: Providing resources for abundance-based solutions
- **Universal Dividend Act**: Ensuring basic security enables cooperation
- **Trust Default Act**: Designing systems that assume human goodness

## Expected Outcomes

### Short-term (1-2 years)
- Elimination of policies that create unnecessary winners and losers
- Development of cooperative problem-solving capacity in government
- Increased citizen trust in policy-making processes
- Pilot programs demonstrating mutual benefit approaches

### Long-term (5+ years)
- Cultural shift from scarcity to abundance thinking
- Systematic cooperation replacing destructive competition
- Policy innovation focused on expanding total wellbeing
- Society-wide experience of mutual support and benefit

## Rationale: Why This Matters

The Two-Monkey Test reflects a simple truth: if we wouldn't treat our beloved pets the way we treat human beings in policy, we shouldn't accept those policies. This Act establishes that human beings deserve at least the level of care and consideration we give to creatures we love.

When policies require some people to suffer for others to benefit, it reveals a failure of imagination and abundance. There are always solutions that benefit everyone when we expand our thinking beyond scarcity assumptions.

*"The true test of any policy is whether you would implement it if everyone affected were someone you deeply love."*
