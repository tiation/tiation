# No-Strike Child Guidance Act

## Short Title

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate (1 year)
- Reduction in physical punishment cases
- Initial public recognition of non-violence benefits
- Early adoption in educational and childcare settings

### Long-term (5+ years)

- Sustained improvement in child wellbeing and development
- Reduction in societal violence as today's children become tomorrow’s adults

## Rationale: Why This Matters

Violence is never an acceptable means of shaping behavior, especially towards vulnerable children. As we seek to build a society rooted in justice, empathy, and collaboration, we must start with how we guide and raise our young.

Our responsibility is to provide children with the warmth, understanding, and education needed to develop without resorting to harmful practices. No child should fear those entrusted with their care.

This Act sets a clear standard: all children deserve environments free from violence, rich in guidance, and grounded in respect.
