### About

Tia Astor is the founder of Tiation, a movement born from personal tragedy and transformed into systemic solutions. With a background in criminology, justice, and psychological science, Tia brings a unique perspective to understanding how systems fail people and how they can be redesigned.

The combination of studying criminal justice systems, psychological frameworks, and counselling approaches has informed Tiation's core philosophy: "People aren't broken, systems are." This multidisciplinary education provides the foundation for Tiation's holistic approach to systemic change.

### Vision

Through Tiation, Tia works to transform grief into design blueprints for better systems. The movement encompasses:

- **The $19 Trillion Solution** - Demonstrating how Australia's collective wealth can create abundance for all
- **Grief to Design Methodology** - Turning personal loss into systemic prevention
- **Open Source Everything** - Building transparent, collaborative solutions
- **Community-Centered Change** - Creating systems that serve people, not the other way around
