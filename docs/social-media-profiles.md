**About Section:**
```
Tiation is a movement born from personal tragedy, transformed into systemic solutions. We believe people aren't broken—systems are—and we're building the tools, policies, and communities to fix them.

Founded by Tia Astor (Master of Counselling - Notre Dame Australia (deferred), Grad Cert Psychological Science - ACAP 2021, Bachelor of Criminology & Justice - Griffith 2018), Tiation combines rigorous academic understanding of justice systems, psychological frameworks, and human behavior with lived experience of systemic failure.

Our flagship initiative, the $19 Trillion Solution, demonstrates how Australia's collective wealth can create abundance for all citizens. Through our Grief to Design methodology, we transform loss into blueprints for a better world.

We're not just theorizing—we're building:
• Open-source platforms for systemic change
• Policy frameworks for economic abundance
• Communities centered on healing and growth
• Educational resources for systems thinking

Join us in creating systems worthy of the people they serve.
