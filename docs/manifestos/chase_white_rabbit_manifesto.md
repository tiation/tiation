# Chase White Rabbit Manifesto

**"People aren't broken. Systems are."**

Chase White Rabbit invites us to reimagine and rebuild our world with a systemic perspective. We acknowledge that at the root, it's not the individuals who are flawed but the systems they navigate and endure daily. This is our call for change.

## Key Philosophies

- **Systemic Thinking:** Address root causes, not symptoms.
- **Abundance Mindset:** There's enough for everyone.
- **Human-Centered:** Technology serves humanity.
- **Youth as Teachers:** Learn from the next generation.
- **Open Source:** Transparent, collaborative development.
- **Justice & Joy:** Both are essential.

Join us to create a world that is just, abundant, and truly human-centered.
