# Grief to Design Manifesto

**"People are good. Systems are broken. We can fix the systems."**

Born from deeply personal loss, the Grief to Design movement aims to transform that grief into systemic action. It stands as a reminder that empathy and understanding can dismantle broken structures and lay new, life-affirming foundations.

## Core Elements

- **Understanding Loss:** Acknowledge personal grief and its systemic roots.
- **Building Prevention:** Design just, open, kind, and autonomous systems.
- **Cultural Transformation:** Advocate redundant safety nets and community-centric policies.
- **Ownership of Recovery:** Turn narratives of grief into templates for systemic redesign.

Together, we can avoid future pain and foster systems built on justice, learning, and unity.
