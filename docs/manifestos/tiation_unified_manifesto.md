# Tiation: Unified Manifesto

**"People aren't broken, fix the systems."**

## Our Origin Story

Tiation unites two powerful movements born from different contexts but sharing a common truth: the systems we live within are the source of our collective struggles, not the people themselves.

**Chase White Rabbit** emerged from the conviction that we need to follow our curiosity down to the root causes of systemic problems. Like Alice following the white rabbit, we pursue solutions that address the foundation, not just the symptoms.

**Grief to Design** was born from personal loss and the recognition that tragedy often has systemic roots. It transforms grief into a blueprint for prevention, turning personal pain into collective healing.

Together, they form **Tiation** - a unified approach to systemic change that combines analytical curiosity with compassionate action.

## Core Philosophy

### People Aren't Broken, Systems Are

This is our fundamental belief. When we see:
- Crime and violence
- Poverty and inequality  
- Mental health crises
- Environmental destruction
- Political dysfunction

We don't blame individuals. We examine the systems that create these conditions and work to redesign them.

### Abundance Over Scarcity

We reject the myth of scarcity that drives competition and conflict. There is enough for everyone when systems are designed for abundance rather than hoarding.

### Justice AND Joy

True systemic change must address both justice (fixing what's broken) and joy (creating what's beautiful). We need systems that don't just prevent harm but actively promote flourishing.

## Our Approach

### 1. Systemic Analysis (Chase White Rabbit)
- **Follow the rabbit:** Trace problems to their roots
- **Question everything:** Challenge assumptions about "how things work"
- **Think systemically:** Address causes, not symptoms
- **Learn from youth:** Value fresh perspectives and curiosity

### 2. Grief-to-Design Transformation
- **Acknowledge loss:** Honor what has been harmed or lost
- **Find systemic roots:** Identify how systems created or enabled that loss
- **Design prevention:** Create systems that prevent future harm
- **Build with love:** Let grief transform into protective action

### 3. Unified Implementation (Tiation)
- **Fast and beautiful:** Our solutions should be both effective and inspiring
- **Open and transparent:** All our work is open source and collaborative
- **Human-centered:** Technology serves humanity, not the other way around
- **Abundance-based:** Design for thriving, not just surviving

## Our Promise

- Build solutions that are both just and joyful
- Never stop until systems serve people, not the other way around
- Honor those we've lost by preventing future loss
- Create abundance for all, not just a few

**Together, we can build systems worthy of the people they serve.**
