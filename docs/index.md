## 🌟 Overview

Tiation is a unified platform for systemic change and human flourishing. We believe that people aren't broken - systems are. Our mission is to trace problems to their root causes and design solutions that assume abundance rather than scarcity.

### Core Mission

**"People Aren't Broken. Fix the Systems."**

This fundamental belief drives everything we do. Instead of blaming individuals for societal problems, we focus on understanding and transforming the systems that create these challenges.

### Key Principles

- 🔍 **Systemic Analysis** - Trace problems to their root causes
- ∞ **Abundance Design** - Design assuming there's enough for everyone
- ❤️ **Human-Centered Tech** - Technology should empower people
- 🌐 **Open Source Everything** - Knowledge wants to be free

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

### Our Approach

1. **Trace problems to their root causes** - We don't treat symptoms
2. **Design systems assuming abundance** - Replace scarcity with cooperation
3. **Build technology that empowers people** - Enhance human potential
4. **Share everything open source** - Enable others to build upon our work

### Movement Origins

Tiation unites powerful movements for systemic change:

#### 🐰 Chase White Rabbit
Following curiosity to find systemic solutions through research and analysis.

#### 💔 Grief to Design
Transforming personal loss into blueprints for prevention and healing.
