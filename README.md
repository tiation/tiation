# Tiation

**"People aren't broken, fix the systems."**

A unified platform for systemic change and human flourishing, born from the merger of Chase White Rabbit and Grief to Design movements.

## Our Story

Tiation unites two powerful movements:

- **Chase White Rabbit**: Following curiosity to find systemic solutions through research and analysis
- **Grief to Design**: Transforming personal loss into blueprints for prevention and healing

Together, they form a comprehensive approach to creating systems that serve humanity rather than harm it.

## Core Philosophy

### People Aren't Broken, Systems Are

When we see crime, poverty, mental health crises, or other social problems, we don't blame individuals. We examine the systems that create these conditions and work to redesign them.

### Our Approach

1. **Systemic Analysis**: Trace problems to their root causes
2. **Abundance Design**: Create systems assuming there's enough for everyone
3. **Human-Centered Technology**: Build tools that empower people
4. **Justice AND Joy**: Address both preventing harm and creating flourishing
5. **Open Source Everything**: Share all knowledge and tools freely

## What We're Building

- **Community Platforms**: Connect people working on systemic change
- **Resource Networks**: Share resources and mutual aid
- **Educational Tools**: Teach systemic thinking and solution design
- **Research Repository**: Document what works and what doesn't
- **Policy Frameworks**: Template legislation for systemic reform
