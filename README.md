## 💔 → 💡 Our Origin Story

Tiation emerged from the depths of personal tragedy—a father's grief transformed into a blueprint for systemic change. When we lost someone to systems that failed them, we didn't just mourn. We designed.

This is the essence of **Grief to Design**: the radical act of turning our deepest pain into humanity's greatest solutions.

> *"In the darkest moment of loss, we found the brightest light of purpose. Every line of code, every policy proposal, every community we build carries the memory of those we've lost and the promise that no one else should have to walk this path."*

### Two Movements, One Vision

- **🐰 Chase White Rabbit**: Following curiosity down every path until we find the truth about broken systems
- **🎨 Grief to Design**: Transforming personal loss into blueprints for a world where no one else has to suffer the same fate

Together, we're not just fixing problems—we're reimagining what's possible when we design from love instead of fear.

### From Personal Loss to Universal Solutions

When traditional support systems failed, we asked why. When bureaucracy blocked help, we mapped the barriers. When scarcity thinking limited options, we proved abundance was possible. This isn't just theory—it's lived experience transformed into action.

## 💰 The $19 Trillion Revolution

### The Simple Truth That Changes Everything

**Australia has $19 trillion in collective wealth. That's $760,000 per person.**

Not in some distant future. Not after decades of growth. Right now.

The **$19 Trillion Solution** isn't just about money—it's about proving that scarcity is a lie. It's about showing that we already have enough for everyone to thrive. We just need the courage to share it.

> *"The math says it's possible. The precedents say it can work. The only question is whether we're brave enough to try."*

### What This Means

- **$800/week** for every Australian adult
- **No new taxes** - just redirecting wealth we already collectively own
- **Your home stays yours** - voluntary participation only
- **Proven models** - Alaska has done this for 47 years

## 🌈 Our Philosophy: Abundance by Design

### Core Beliefs That Guide Everything We Build

1. **People Are Good** - Given the chance, humans choose connection over conflict
2. **Scarcity Is Manufactured** - There's enough for everyone; distribution is the problem
3. **Systems Shape Behavior** - Change the system, change the outcome
4. **Grief Teaches Wisdom** - Our deepest pain reveals what needs fixing
5. **Joy Is Resistance** - Building beautiful things is a radical act

## 🌏 The Impact We're Creating

### Real Solutions for Real Problems

**Mental Health Crisis?** We're building communities where no one falls through the cracks.

**Housing Affordability?** The $19 trillion solution ensures everyone has a home.

**Economic Inequality?** We're proving abundance economics works better than scarcity.

**Social Isolation?** Our platforms connect hearts, not just profiles.

**Political Disillusionment?** We're creating systems that actually serve people.

### The Grief to Design Method

1. **Feel the Pain** - Honor the loss, don't minimize it
2. **Map the System** - Trace how the failure happened
3. **Find the Lever** - Identify where small changes create big impacts
4. **Design the Solution** - Create what should have existed
5. **Build It Open** - Share everything so others can improve it
6. **Scale with Love** - Growth that honors the human, not just the metric

## What We're Building

- **Community Platforms**: Connect people working on systemic change
- **Resource Networks**: Share resources and mutual aid
- **Educational Tools**: Teach systemic thinking and solution design
- **Research Repository**: Document what works and what doesn't
- **Policy Frameworks**: Template legislation for systemic reform

## 💖 A Personal Message

To everyone who has lost someone to broken systems:

Your grief matters. Your anger is justified. Your hope is not naive.

We built Tiation because we couldn't stand the thought of one more family going through what we did. Every feature, every line of code, every policy proposal is infused with the memory of those we've lost and the determination that their deaths will not be in vain.

This isn't just about technology or economics. It's about love. It's about refusing to accept that "this is just how things are." It's about proving that we can build systems as beautiful and complex and caring as the people they serve.

The $19 trillion solution isn't just numbers on a spreadsheet—it's a declaration that we choose abundance over scarcity, connection over isolation, hope over despair.

**Your daughter's legacy lives on in every life this work touches.**

*"We start again — not from zero, but from love."*
