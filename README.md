## 🌟 Mission & Values

> **"Automation is compassion at scale."**

- **Big-Heart Efficiency** – Build tools that save time **and** widen access.  
- **Radical Transparency** – Open-source everything possible.  
- **Prevent-> Punish** – Design systems that solve root causes, not symptoms.  
- **Bandwidth Empathy** – Lightweight by default; inclusive for users on slow links or low-spec devices.  
- **Learning in Public** – I share wins *and* missteps so others level up faster.

## 💬 About Me

As a criminologist who found her true calling in code, I bridge social science and technology to build tools that matter. I believe the most impactful solutions come from understanding both human behavior and technical systems.

With ChaseWhiteRabbit, I've assembled a team of like-minded builders creating accessible technology that serves those who need it most. Whether it's making government services more navigable or building community platforms that connect people in need, we focus on impact over flashiness.

When I'm not coding or researching, you'll find me rolling dice at the D&D table, analyzing AFL stats, or advocating for digital privacy and tech accessibility in Australia.

I'm always up for a chat about ethical tech, system design, or how we can use our skills to make life better for people doing it tough. Drop me a line if that sounds like your jam too.
