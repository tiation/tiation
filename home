## 🌟 Mission & Values

> **“Automation is compassion at scale.”**

- **Big-Heart Efficiency** – Build tools that save time **and** widen access.  
- **Radical Transparency** – Open-source everything possible.  
- **Prevent-> Punish** – Design systems that solve root causes, not symptoms.  
- **Bandwidth Empathy** – Lightweight by default; inclusive for users on slow links or low-spec devices.  
- **Learning in Public** – I share wins *and* missteps so others level up faster.
